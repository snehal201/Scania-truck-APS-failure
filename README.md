# Scania-truck-APS-failure

Scania truck APS failure project is a data analysis project that aims to understand the root causes of Automatic Power Shift (APS) transmission failures in Scania trucks. The goal of the project is to identify patterns and trends in the data that can help to predict and prevent APS failures in the future.

### A Scania truck APS failure project typically involves the following steps:

1. Collecting and pre-processing data: This may involve gathering data from various sources such as truck maintenance records, sensor data from the trucks, and customer complaints. The data is then cleaned, organized, and prepared for analysis.

2. Data analysis: Statistical and machine learning techniques are used to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends that are related to APS failures. This may include techniques such as data visualization, descriptive statistics, and predictive modeling.

3. Identifying root causes: Based on the analysis, the project team can identify the root causes of APS failures.

4. Developing recommendations: The project team develops recommendations for preventing APS failures in the future. This may involve changes to maintenance procedures, updates to the truck's software or hardware, or changes to the way that the trucks are operated.

5. Implementing and monitoring recommendations: The recommendations are implemented and the effectiveness of the changes are monitored.

6. Continual improvement: The project team continues to monitor the data and make changes as needed to improve the performance of the APS transmission and reduce the risk of failure.

## The goal of this project is to understand the underlying cause of Automatic Power Shift (APS) transmission failures in Scania trucks, through data analysis and identifying patterns and trends in the data, to predict and prevent such failures in the future. This will help Scania trucks to have fewer breakdowns, reducing downtime and increasing the satisfaction of the customers.
